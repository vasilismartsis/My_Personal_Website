The service that has been implemented as a website called MyRecipeList, is an online service in which the user can search for recipes based on the ingredients available. This service is aimed at people who own, limited or want to experiment with new, cooking materials. This service, unlike other similar services on the internet, which provide a simple recipe search by name, can free the hands of people belonging to the above categories. A particular example of a category of people who could help is those who are facing financial problems that may lead to a lack of ingredients needed to make many recipes. Another category of people are those who want to be involved in the art of cooking but do not have special knowledge in this field.
